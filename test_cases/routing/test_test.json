By 1980, Microsoft partnered with IBM to provide the MS-DOS operating system for IBM PCs. This partnership catapulted Microsoft to become a major player in the software industry. In 1985, Microsoft released the first version of Windows, which would later become the world's most widely used operating system. The company went public in 1986, and by 1988, it had become the world's largest personal computer software company by sales. Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft expanded its product line to include networking, web browsing, and e-mail software. The company also entered the multimedia and gaming markets with products like the Microsoft Xbox. In 2001, Microsoft entered the game console market with the Xbox, directly competing with Sony and Nintendo. The Xbox brand has since become a major part of Microsoft's consumer products division. In 2008, Microsoft made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Yahoo! for $44.6 billion. Instead, the company refocused its efforts on search engines, cloud computing, and mobile computing. In 2011, Microsoft acquired Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion, which was at that time the largest acquisition in the company's history.",
